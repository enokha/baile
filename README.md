# Django Studio Reservation System

This project is a Django-based system that allows users to create accounts, authenticate, add studio details, and make reservations. It utilizes Docker to ensure easy setup and consistency across different environments.

### Features

- **User Management**: Create and manage user accounts.
- **Authentication**: Obtain authentication tokens for API access.
- **Studio Management**: Add and manage studio details.
- **Reservations**: Users can make reservations for studios.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine:
- [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Get Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   cd your-project-directory

```

2.  **Build the Docker Containers**
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose build
    ```
    
3.  **Run the Containers**
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
    
    This command will start all the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml`, including your Django application and any databases.
    

Using the API
-------------

Once the application is running, you can use the following endpoints to interact with the system:

### Create a User

*   **Endpoint**: `POST /users/`
*   **Data**:
    
    ```json
    
    {
      "username"
    : "newuser"
    ,
      "password"
    : "newpassword"
    }
    ```
    

### Obtain a Token

*   **Endpoint**: `POST /api-token-auth/`
*   **Data**:
    
    ```json
    
    {
      "username"
    : "newuser"
    ,
      "password"
    : "newpassword"
    }
    ```
    

### Add a Studio

*   **Endpoint**: `POST /studios/`
*   **Header**: `Authorization: Token <Your_Token>`
*   **Data**:
    
    ```json
    
    {
      "name"
    : "New Studio"
    ,
      "location"
    : "Some Location"
    }
    ```
    

### Make a Reservation

*   **Endpoint**: `POST /reservations/`
*   **Header**: `Authorization: Token <Your_Token>`
*   **Data**:
    
    ```json
    
    {
      "studio"
    : studio_id,
      "date"
    : "2024-07-10"
    ,
      "start_time"
    : "12:00"
    ,
      "end_time"
    : "14:00"
    }
    ```
    

Managing the Application
------------------------

To manage your application, use the following Docker Compose commands:

*   **Stopping Containers**:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
    
*   **Viewing Logs**:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs
    ```
    

Troubleshooting
---------------

*   **Container not starting**: Check Docker logs for any errors during startup.
*   **Database issues**: Ensure the database configuration in `docker-compose.yml` matches your Django settings.
